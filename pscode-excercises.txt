// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for number
divide given number by 2
if number divides to whole number output "Even", if output is not whole number output "Odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

1. Read 5 numbers Assign variable 1a 1b 1c 1d and 1e to each number respectively. 
2. Add 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d and 1e. divide total by 5. Assign "variable 2"
3. Assess the 5 numbers and output the smallest, assign "variable 3"
4. Assess the 5 numbers and output the largest, assign "variable 4"
5. output:
	Values given: output "1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e" 
	Average: output "variable 2"
	Minimum: output "variable 3"
	Maximum: output "variable 4"
